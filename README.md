## profile
Hello. My name is Dayoung and I'm a first year MURP concentratining in Design & Development and in Regional Economic Development. I grew up in Koreatown Los Angeles, moved out to Santa Clarita in high school, and have been back and forth from the San Fernando Valley and Westwood since undergrad. I conducted direct outreach with unhoused neighbors in Westwood during the peak of the COVID Pandemic from 2020 and 2022, where I discovered the dire need to implement sustainable urban planning practices at the root of the system. My interests lie in affordable housing and public recreational spaces without surveillance and the fear of criminalization. 

## course description and objectives 
My understanding of the course is that we will be taught coding language to perform data visualization of maps. The objectives of this course are to learn coding basics and create models of maps through data collection for our research and planning practices. We will be taught to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data by the end of the course to apply the data science programming techniques in our place-based informatics which inform urban policy. 
I'd like to be able to take what I learn from this course and make the information accessible in layman's terms -- for the neighbors of the communities on where the data visualization will be based. It would also be doubly nice to become familiar with coding language, since that is now how everything operates and will allow for flexibility in creating maps. 

## project ideas
* maps of public bathrooms in west LA
* successful affordable housing units in LA and where they are concentrated
* sites of redevelopment and gentrification 
* sites of community contestation (including recreational and retail)
* maps of the internal migration of different demographics across the LA County in the last few decades (and exploring how migrating patterns are still happening)
